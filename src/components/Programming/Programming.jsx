        Top 5 Programming languages for Web development in 2021
      </h1>
      <p>
        Without wasting any more of your time, here is a list of best
        programming languages for web development, In the order of their
        importance and popularity. <br />
        <br />
        Though, you don’t need to learn all of these programming languages,
        choose the one which you like and which meets your requirement. If you
        are stuck or get confused, choose JavaScript, as you can never get wrong
        with that.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1 className="text-3xl mb-3">1. JavaScript</h1>

      <p>
        There is no doubt that JavaScript is the King of web development and
        probably the most popular language among web developers. It’s also the
        only language that allows you to create web applications, both frontend,
        and backend as well as mobile applications (React Native).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The strength of Javascript is not just it can run on browser and server
        using Nodejs but also the awesome frameworks and libraries it has for
        web development and app development. For example, you can use React.js
        and Angular for frontend, Nodejs for backend, and React Native for
        creating cross-platform (both Android and iOS) mobile apps.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are starting with a web development career then I highly
        recommend you to learn Javascript in 2021 and if you need resources, I
        recommend The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project by
        Azad on Azad Academy. This is one of the best online courses to learn
        JavaScript.

      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-4 mb-3">2. Python</h1>
      <p>
        Python is another language which has gained a lot of popularity in
        recent year. While it's not exactly new and has passed the test of time,
        it's probably the most versatile programming language at the moment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can use Python for web development, Data Science, Scripting, and
        Automation. Similar to JavaScript, Python also enjoys huge community
        support and has a lot of useful frameworks, libraries, and tools that
        can help you create a web application in quick time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example, you can use Django to create full-stack web applications.
        If you want more control, you can also use Flask, a minimalist web
        development framework.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Python is also a good programming language to learn Coding, so if you
        are new to the software development world then choosing Python can be a
        great start, not just for web development but for an overall programming
        career. Now, if you need resources to learn Python in 2021, I highly
        recommend Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python
        course by Jose Portilla on Udemy.
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-4 mb-3">3. TypeScript</h1>
      <p>
        TypeScript is my personal favorite and a modern programming language for
        web development. Just like we have C and C++, TypeScript can be
        considered as JavaScript++ though it’s not as popular as C++.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The good part of TypeScript is that it adds type-safety in JavaScript
        code which means you can catch nasty JavaScript type-related errors in
        the development phase.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It also makes developing object-oriented code easy for JavaScript and
        several inbuilt debugging tools of TypeScript make web development
        really easy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have to choose a modern programming language to learn in 2021, I
        highly recommend you to learn TypeScript and if you need a resource,
        Understanding TypeScript by Maximillian Scwarzmuller and AcadMind is a
        great course to start with on Udemy.
      </p>

      />
      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-4 mb-3">4. PHP</h1>
      <p>
        I may get a lot of flaks for including PHP in this list of best
        programming languages for web development in 2021 but to be honest, PHP
        is one of the best programming languages when it comes to creating web
        applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It’s a dynamic, server-side scripting language that makes it really easy
        to create fully functional web applications. If that’s not enough, half
        of the internet is running on PHP’s shoulder, remember WordPress, the
        most popular web application software is made on PHP.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PHP also has frameworks like Laraval, which is both powerful and allows
        you to swiftly create web applications using a model–view–controller
        architectural pattern.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Don’t listen to people who say PHP is not useful, if you find it easy,
        go for it, and If you are want to learn PHP for web development in 2021
        and need a resource, I highly recommend PHP with Laravel for beginners —
        Become a Master in Laravel course from Udemy. A great online course to
        learn both PHP and Laravel in depth.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <h1 className="text-3xl mt-4 mb-3">5. Ruby</h1>
      <p>
        Ruby is another programming language that is really great for web
        development. Similar to PHP and Python, Ruby is also easy to learn and
        goo for beginners.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What makes Ruby special for web development is the Ruby on Rails
        framework which powers websites like Github, Shopify, Airbnb, Groupon,
        GoodReads, and Kickstarter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you don’t know, Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework,
        providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web
        pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as
        JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user
        interfacing
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you want to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails in 2021, I highly recommend
        you to check out The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer course by Rob
        Percival on Udemy. One of the best course to learn web development with
        Ruby on Rails and unleash your creativity
